# Protein Structure Predictor

## Brief Description

This is a python-based machine learning algorithm to predict the three-dimensional structure of a given sequence of amino acids. This predictor is still being actively studied in the field of computational biology. This will be looking particularly at the proteins responsible for transporting and storing oxygen, Myoglobin.

## Data Sources

- Protein Data Bank

## Data Fields associated with Data Source

The following are the data fields extracted from the data source in order to help extrapolate data along with a brief description explaining each data field:

- PDB ID - identifying protein structure with a combination of numerical and alphabetical values. 
- Atomic coordinates - atoms position within the protein structure. 
- Secondary structure - hydrogen bonding patterns in a protein.
- Ligands- molecules/ ions connected to the protein.
- Experimental Technique- protein structure determination methods
- Resolution- accuracy and quality of the protein structure data.
- Citation information - references for each protein structure.
