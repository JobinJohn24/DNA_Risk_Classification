# Protein Structure Predictor

## Project Overview

This is a python-based machine learning algorithm to predict the three-dimensional structure of a given sequence of amino acids. This predictor is still being actively studied in the field of computational biology. This will be look particularly at the proteins responsible for transporting oxygen beneficial for the immune system, hemoglobin. More specifically, the hemoglobin proteins that's being researched along this project are Deoxy Human Hemoglobin, Third Quaternary Structure of Human Hemoglobin A at 1.7 Angstroms, and the Hemoglobin Subunit beta. We'll discuss along the project about using spaitial distribution analysis through data visualization, and the main focus is the target variable which is the Gibbs free energy of the researched proteins. 

## Data Sources

- Protein Data Bank (PDB)

## Data Fields associated with Data Source

The following are the data fields extracted from the data source in order to help extrapolate data along with a brief description explaining each data field:

- PDB ID - identifying protein structure with a combination of numerical and alphabetical values. 
  * Atomic coordinates - atoms position within the protein structure. 
  * Secondary structure - hydrogen bonding patterns in a protein.
  * Ligands- molecules/ ions connected to the protein.
  * Experimental Technique- protein structure determination methods
  * Resolution- accuracy and quality of the protein structure data.
  * Citation information - references for each protein structure.


## Background information

This is a machine learning algorithm in order to predict the three dimensional structure of the input of an amino acid sequence. The importance of a 3D protein structural predictor is to further understand the function of proteins, development of new drugs and treatments. Along with helping related fields like medicine, and research, this predictor can also help fields such as agriculture, biofuels, and a lot more fields.
