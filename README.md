# Protein Structure Predictor

## Brief Description

This is a python-based machine learning algorithm to predict the three-dimensional structure of a given sequence of amino acids. This predictor is still being actively studied in the field of computational biology. This will be looking particularly at the proteins responsible for transporting and storing oxygen, Myoglobin.

## Data Sources

- Protein Data Bank

## Data Fields associated with Data Source

The following are the data fields extracted from the data source in order to help extrapolate data along with a brief description explaining each data field:

- PDB ID - identifying protein structure with a combination of numerical and alphabetical values. 
- Atomic coordinates - atoms position within the protein structure. 
- Secondary structure - hydrogen bonding patterns in a protein.
- Ligands- molecules/ ions connected to the protein.
- Experimental Technique- protein structure determination methods
- Resolution- accuracy and quality of the protein structure data.
- Citation information - references for each protein structure.


##Background information

This is a machine learning algorithm in order to predict the three dimensional structure of the input of an amino acid sequence. The importance of a 3D protein structural predictor is to further understand the function of proteins, development of new drugs and treatments. Along with helping related fields like medicine, and research, this predictor can also help fields such as agriculture, biofuels, and a lot more fields.

Proteins are essentially molecules made of amino acids connected with peptide bonds. The structure of protein is organized into four structures; primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary structure is a linear order of amino acids connected by peptide bonds, but the linear sequence is determined upon the genetic information (DNA) that specifically tells the sequence within the protein. The secondary structure is the patterns of folding of the amino acid sequence. These patterns are called alpha-helices, beta pleated sheets, and random coil regions. The difference between all these types of secondary protein structures are the spatial arrangement, for example in a alpha-helix amino acids are arranged in a spiral, while the beta-pleated sheets are arranged in a pattern of zig zags. While the random coil regions are arranged randomly hence the name random. The tertiary structure is
